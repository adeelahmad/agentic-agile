# Mandate
Sprint <N> is PAUSED mid-execution: the tasks below hit their HARD budget and were
killed. Split them into smaller tasks that fit the budget. Do not retry them as-is.

# Status
## Done (DO NOT TOUCH — tasks.md sections, plan.md bullets, plan-ready.md ticks stay as-is)
- <SN-NN Tk> — merged green

## Killed at hard limit (SPLIT these)
- <SN-NN Tk> — <tokens used>/<tokens_hard> tokens, <minutes>/<time_hard> min, role <red|green>;
  last output.md block: <path>#<header>; transcript: docs/agents/.agentic/transcripts/<task>/

## Not started (may re-size if the split changes the dependency graph)
- <SN-NN Tk>

# Budget in force
tokens_soft=<n> tokens_hard=<n> time_soft=<n>m time_hard=<n>m

# Scope
## May
Edit tasks.md / validate.md / plan.md of the OPEN tasks' stories (only the OPEN tasks'
sections) and sprint<N>/plan.md waves.
## May Not
Touch a DONE task; move work into a later sprint; write code or tests.

# Acceptance
Every killed task is replaced by >= 2 smaller tasks, each with its own plan.md tests
and validate.md rubric; sprint<N>/plan.md waves updated; gate-stage2-complete passes.
