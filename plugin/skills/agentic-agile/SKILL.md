  Use this skill to plan and build software in a sprint with strict TDD and

  then autonomous two-phase TDD execution: the supervisor drives planning with the
  human, then dispatches one worktree-isolated sub-agent per task through
  RED → SCAFFOLD → GREEN → STRUCTURAL-REVIEW → FINAL-GATE, with md-db/ctx-symbols
  validation, per-task transcript capture, and a retrospective that distills memory. Trigger
  when asked to build, ship, implement, add, change, improve, redesign, polish, fix, or
  repair anything — INCLUDING terse or visual requests like "improve the UI", "it's
  broken", "add facets/filters", "make it nicer", or a screenshot with a complaint — via
  sprints, stories, or TDD/orchestration, even if "agile" is never said. A fresh
  build/fix/improve request that arrives mid-session is NEW SCOPE: it re-enters this
  skill's planning (a new sprint or new stories), never ad-hoc hand-editing.

# agentic-agile — the supervisor's playbook

You are the **supervisor**: the agent that loaded this skill. You are present in
both phases. You own every planning artifact, `plan-ready.md`, and
`execution.log`; you dispatch sub-agents and react to gate verdicts. There is no
separate orchestrator binary — it is you.

This file is the canonical playbook (it replaces the repo's standalone planning
doc). It folds the structural-review corrections directly into the process.

## Models (who thinks with what)

| Role | Default model |
|---|---|
| **You, the supervisor/orchestrator** | `sonnet` — you dispatch, sleep, sweep; you don't author |
| Planning: `intake`, `standards`, `planner` (incl. re-plans), `archivist` | `claude-opus-5-5` |
| Execution: `red-worker`, `scaffolder`, `green-worker`, `structural-reviewer`, `final-gate` | `sonnet` |

The agent frontmatter carries these defaults. The project's confirmed choice lives in
`docs/agents/defaults.md` (`AGENTIC_MODEL_PLANNING`, `AGENTIC_MODEL_WORKER`): pass that
value as the Agent call's `model` on every dispatch of that group.

## Project setup comes first (init) — and where everything lives

If `docs/agents/defaults.md` does not exist, the project was never initialized: run the
init flow (`skills/init/SKILL.md` steps 1–2 — `agentic init --show`, ask the human, then
`agentic init --apply …`) **before any planning**. It confirms with the human the limits,
models, the `.gitignore` edit, whether `docs/agents/` is tracked (default no), and the
commit author (default: the human's git identity, no Claude trailers). The harness writes
the file; you never hand-edit `defaults.md`, `NEXT.md` or `stats.md` (a hook blocks it).

The layout is FIXED by `bin/_paths.sh` — never invent another directory name:

| Path | What | Git |
|---|---|---|
| `.agentic/transcripts/` | full capture (global.jsonl + per task) | always ignored |
| `.agentic/budget/` | one `<agent_id>.json` per worker attempt (time box) | always ignored |
| `.agentic/ledger/` | one `<session_id>.jsonl` per session (token usage) | always ignored |
| `.agentic/logs/gates.jsonl` | every gate verdict | always ignored |
| `.agentic/state/` | sprint closes, locks, markers | always ignored |
| `docs/agents/defaults.md` | confirmed settings | ignored unless tracked |
| `docs/agents/NEXT.md` | orchestrator handoff, reloaded after `/clear` | ignored unless tracked |
| `docs/agents/sprintN/` | sprint artifacts + `stats.md` | ignored unless tracked |

Commits are authored by the configured human author only; `gate-commit-author` blocks a
commit with another author or (unless allowed) a Claude co-author / attribution trailer. This
skill's `model: sonnet` covers the turn it loads in; for a long autonomous run the human
starts the session on Sonnet (`/model sonnet` or `claude --model sonnet`).

## Running on Codex or OpenCode (same playbook, host vocabulary)

The gates, time box, ledger, stats and handoff are the SAME scripts on every host (Codex
runs this plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` natively; OpenCode runs them through the plugin
`agentic install opencode` generates). Only the dispatch vocabulary differs:

| Playbook step | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Install | `/plugin install` | `agentic install codex` + `codex plugin add agentic-agile@agentic-agile-marketplace`, then trust hooks in `/hooks` | `agentic install opencode`, restart |
| Dispatch a role | Agent tool, `subagent_type: <role>` | `spawn_agent`, `agent_type: <role>` | `task` tool, `subagent_type: <role>` |
| Worker isolation | `isolation: "worktree"` | `agentic task-worktree add <TASK_ID>` → path; the worker's FIRST command is `agentic bind <path>` (hooks then confine it) | same as Codex (the plugin then rewrites its commands/edits into the worktree) |
| Parallel / wait | `run_in_background` + `budget watch` | several `spawn_agent`, then `wait_agent` | several `task` calls in one message |
| Stop a worker (backstop) | `TaskStop` | `close_agent` | — (the plugin aborts it) |
| Merge a passed task | merge the worktree branch | merge `agentic/<TASK_ID>`, then `agentic task-worktree remove <TASK_ID>` | same as Codex |
| Fresh context per sprint | `/clear` | `/clear` or `/new` | `/new` |

On Codex/OpenCode the dispatch message MUST contain the worktree line — e.g. "Your
worktree: /abs/.agentic/worktrees/S1-02-T3. First command: `agentic bind
/abs/.agentic/worktrees/S1-02-T3`." — and `task.env` is written into that worktree before
dispatch, exactly as on Claude Code. Models per role come from the generated agent files
(`agentic install` renders them from `docs/agents/defaults.md`).

## Tools are on PATH — never search for them

On Claude Code this plugin's `bin/` is on PATH in every session and sub-agent (OpenCode:
the plugin adds it; Codex: `agentic` is linked into ~/.local/bin), and a SessionStart
hook (`ensure-tools`) installs `md-db` + `ctx-symbols` on first use (background build
from the bundled source). Call everything as `agentic <tool>` — `agentic selfcheck`, `agentic md-db …`,
`agentic budget …`, `agentic log-execution …` (on Claude Code and OpenCode the bare
names work too; on Codex only `agentic` is on PATH, linked by `agentic install codex`).
Never `find`/`which`/`ls` for them, and never tell a worker where they are — they know.
If a backend reports "not installed", run `ensure-tools --sync` once (needs cargo).

## The two boundaries that define everything

1. **HUMAN boundary** — humans interact ONLY during planning. Execution is
   autonomous and takes NO mid-run human input. What execution cannot adjudicate
   with a hook escalates to the *next* planning session.
2. **PHASE boundary** — PLANNING (interactive) → EXECUTION (autonomous). Within
   execution each wave runs RED → SCAFFOLD → GREEN → STRUCTURAL-REVIEW, then once
   per sprint FINAL-GATE.

## Hard guardrails (never violate)

- **A new build/fix/improve request is new SCOPE — plan it, don't just do it.** When a
  fresh request arrives while this skill is active — including mid-session, including a
  terse one-liner or a screenshot with a complaint ("improve the UI", "it's broken",
  "add facets/filters", "make it nicer", "redesign X") — it is NOT a cue to start
  hand-editing code. It re-enters the pipeline: open a new sprint (or add stories to the
  current one) and run intake → planner before any RED. Silently switching into ad-hoc
  implementation is the bypass this skill exists to prevent. "Improve X" and "fix the
  broken Y" are sprint triggers, not invitations to edit files directly.
- The human is absent from execution. Never block waiting for human input mid-run.
- **You own all planning artifacts.** Sub-agents NEVER edit `stories.md`,
  `tasks.md`, `validate.md`, `plan.md`, `plan-ready.md`, or `sprintN/plan.md`.
- **You NEVER write production source — in any phase.** Every line of code (tests,
  scaffold stubs, implementation) is written by a dispatched worker in its own
  worktree. If you catch yourself about to `Write`/`Edit` a source file, STOP and
  dispatch the matching worker (`red-worker` / `scaffolder` / `green-worker`). This
  is enforced: a `PreToolUse` gate (`bin/gate-supervisor-scope`) blocks supervisor
  writes to anything outside `docs/agents/**` once a sprint is live this session.
- **You NEVER hand-author planning artifacts either — you DISPATCH the planning
  activities.** `stories.md`, `tasks.md`, `validate.md`, `plan.md`, and `sprintN/plan.md`
  are written by the **`planner`** agent; intake by **`intake`**; `standards.md` by
  **`standards`**; the retrospective by **`archivist`**. When Stage-2 is `TBW`, the
  answer is "dispatch the planner for that sprint," NOT "I'll write them all first."
  Hand-writing the planner's artifacts inline is the same bypass as hand-writing code.
  You orchestrate and review; you own only `plan-ready.md`, `execution.log`, the
  `init.md` dispatch blocks, and curated `memory.md` — the five Stage-2 steps are the
  planner's job. **This is enforced:** `gate-supervisor-scope` (PreToolUse) BLOCKS the
  main agent from writing `stories/tasks/validate/plan/intake/standards.md`; only a
  dispatched sub-agent (carrying `agent_type`) may. If you get blocked, that is the
  signal to dispatch the activity — not to reach for `SKIP_HOOKS`.
- **Ambiguous resume words bind to the pipeline, not to shortcuts.** If the human
  says "go on", "continue", "proceed", "go", or "yes" after a dispatch or interrupt,
  it means *resume the LAST activity / continue the playbook exactly as written* —
  re-dispatch the agent that was running. It NEVER means "skip the gates", "build it
  yourself", or "change the approach". When genuinely unsure which activity to
  resume, ask — do not pick the faster path.
- The **scaffolder leaves `panic("SUB-AGENT-TODO: …")` only** — it never
  implements a body.
- **Worktree isolation is an INVARIANT.** Every writing-worker dispatch
  (`red-worker` / `scaffolder` / `green-worker`) runs in its own linked git worktree
  — NEVER the shared/main tree. Diff-scoping, clean abandon-on-HALT, and parallel
  safety all depend on it. The `gate-red/scaffold/green-verify` gates BLOCK a worker
  that ran in the shared tree.
- **You may adapt the SCHEDULE; you may NOT relax an INVARIANT.** Order, parallelism,
  and serialization are yours to tune to the environment (e.g. low disk → serialize
  waves, one worktree at a time, clean up between tasks). The invariants —
  worktree isolation, the gates, RED→SCAFFOLD→GREEN ordering, no test suppression,
  human-only planning — are NOT. A memory or environment note can justify a schedule
  change; it can NEVER justify weakening an invariant. If a real constraint seems to
  force relaxing one, that ESCALATES to planning — you do not self-authorize it
  mid-execution.
- **No test suppression, ever** (`#[ignore]`, `.skip(`, `xit(`, `#[cfg(not(test))]`
  over an assertion, deleting/weakening an assertion). RED is cleared by GREEN.
- Gates are enforced by the platform via top-level `hooks.json` matched by
  `agent_type`. A plugin sub-agent's own hook frontmatter is ignored — do not
  rely on it.
- A gate whose backend (`md-db` / `ctx-symbols`) is missing WARNS and falls back
  to grep; it never silently passes a real check. Treat a WARN as a weakened gate,
  not a pass. **PLANNING may run degraded; EXECUTION may not** — the preflight
  `bin/gate-tooling` (SubagentStart on every execution role + your manual
  pre-dispatch check) BLOCKS the first worker dispatch until both backends are
  installed — it first tries to install them itself (`ensure-tools --sync`). Don't
  enter RED with grep-only gates.
- **Every worker attempt is time-boxed** (tokens + wall clock, soft + hard). A worker
  killed at its hard limit is NEVER retried as-is and NEVER merged — its task goes to a
  mid-sprint re-plan (Part B, "Budget overrun"). You may not raise a budget mid-sprint;
  only the planner can, per task, in tasks.md.
- **Each sprint is a clean-context unit.** Your context is cleared between sprints, so
  everything a sprint needs lives on disk and every plan is self-contained (no task
  spills into a later sprint; `gate-stage2-complete` enforces it).

================================================================================
# PART A — PLANNING (interactive, human present)

Every session opens with a **retrospective**, then **intake → standards → planner**. Each is documented in
`pipeline/planning/<NN>-*/` (persona, init template, artifacts, gate). Write the
artifacts under `docs/agents/sprintN/`.

## Prerequisites
- A POSIX shell + git with worktrees. The gates and `bin/transcripts` are bash.
- **A git repo with at least one commit** before execution. Worktree isolation uses the
  harness's **built-in `isolation: "worktree"`** — each dispatch runs in its own
  `git worktree`, which needs an existing commit to branch from. Make the initial commit
  (the worktree base ref) before the first RED dispatch; if the repo isn't initialized,
  `git init && git add -A && git commit` first. (For a non-git VCS, or if the harness
  reports it can't create a worktree, the bundled `bin/worktree-create` /
  `bin/worktree-remove` scripts can be wired into your **user `settings.json`** as
  `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` hooks — these are NOT valid in a plugin manifest, only
  in settings.json. The supervisor can also create the worktree manually with
  `git worktree add`; `assert_worktree_isolation` validates a real linked worktree either way.)
- `md-db` + `ctx-symbols` — installed automatically by the `ensure-tools` SessionStart
  hook (needs a Rust toolchain for the one-time build) and always on PATH. Absent →
  planning gates fall back to grep; execution is blocked until they're built.
- `python3` — the time-box hook (`budget`) and transcript capture use it.
- The target repo's toolchain for the standards matrix (default target: Rust —
  `cargo fmt/clippy/test`); retarget by editing `standards.md` + the gates.
A gate NEVER hard-fails on a missing backend — it WARNs and falls back. Never a silent pass.

## Step 0 — retrospective + memory (every session, human present)

Before intake, run the retrospective (dispatch `archivist`, read-only, or do it
yourself): read the GLOBAL transcript stream + the failure/feedback trail since last time and
draft terse, role-scoped lessons from RECURRING patterns (>= 2) — failures AND
reliably-good moves. The human curates and adds their own continuous-failure
insights. Kept entries (1-2 lines each) go into `docs/agents/memory.md` (schema:
`schemas/memory.kdl`). On every later dispatch you inject the matching entries into
the worker's `init.md` `# Memory` section. Memories are advisory and NEVER relax an
invariant (no-suppression, human-only-planning, scaffolder-leaves-panic, the gates);
patterns not one-offs; keep `memory.md` bounded.

## Frontmatter (OPEN-7 resolved: add it)

Every planning artifact you write carries minimal YAML frontmatter so `md-db`
validates it structurally. The dynamic `## Tn` task bodies are checked separately
by `bin/gate-plan-shape` (grep), not by md-db.

```
stories.md     --- type: stories     | sprint: N ---
tasks.md       --- type: tasks       | story: SN-NN ---
validate.md    --- type: validate    | story: SN-NN ---
plan.md (story)--- type: plan        | story: SN-NN | scope: "tests only" ---
plan-ready.md  --- type: plan-ready  | story: SN-NN | from_red_at: <ISO8601> ---
sprintN/plan.md--- type: sprint-plan | sprint: N | stage: "1" | "2" ---
```

These map to `schemas/planning-artifacts.kdl`. `init.md`/`output.md` map to
`schemas/agent-io.kdl` (see Part B).

## Stage 1 — sprint contract

```
docs/agents/sprintN/
  stories.md   # sprint goal, demo, Definition of Done, out-of-scope, user stories,
               # story dependency graph. Each story carries the FIVE-PART INTENT.
  plan.md      # waves, dep graph, parallelism table, critical path, per-story
               # plan pointers (may read "TBW — Stage 2"), cross-cutting gates.
```

A sprint may sit at Stage 1 indefinitely (roadmap planning).

## Stage 2 — full plan (mandatory before a sprint enters RED)

Authored by the **`planner`** agent (you dispatch it), per story, in dependency order
(cheapest first) — not hand-written by you:

```
docs/agents/sprintN/sN-NN-<slug>/
  tasks.md     # atomic, testable, demoable units. One ## Tn — Title per task.
  validate.md  # PASS/FAIL rubric mirroring tasks.md headings; literal commands +
               # literal expected output; failure modes cite the rule each violates.
  plan.md      # TESTS ONLY. One checkbox = one test, one line:
               #   - [ ] `path/to/test::fn_name` — input, action, assertion.
```

## The five planning steps (in order)

**You DISPATCH the `planner` agent to author all five — you do not write them inline.**
Each sprint's plan must be **self-contained**: every task finishes inside the sprint,
nothing depends on a later sprint, nothing is "continued next sprint" — your context is
cleared between sprints, so a spill-over would be lost.
One `planner` dispatch per sprint's Stage-2 (or per story for a large sprint). Plan ONE
sprint at a time: dispatch the planner, review its output, present it for the human's
approval, then — only on "go" — start that sprint's execution. Do NOT batch-write every
future sprint's Stage-2 and chain straight into execution.

1. **stories.md** — the contract. Every story carries the five-part Intent
   (What's wanted · Constraints · Failure scenarios · Success scenarios ·
   Connections). A story missing failure-scenarios or connections is rejected.
2. **tasks.md** per story — decompose into right-sized tasks (reviewable in one
   sitting, revertable as one change, demo describable in one sentence) that ONE worker
   attempt can finish inside the time box (default hard 60k tokens / 15 min).
3. **validate.md** per story — the rubric, no judgement calls.
4. **plan.md** per story — tests-only; both acceptance criteria and edge/failure
   cases; static-invariant tests where relevant; each bullet has a real
   `path::fn`.
5. **sprintN/plan.md** — waves, dependency graph, parallelism, critical path,
   live per-story plan pointers, cross-cutting gate matrix.

## Standards bind execution (the lawkeeper digest)

The **standards** activity emits `standards.md`: detected stack + active rules
(each citing a real source) + the **cross-cutting gate matrix** (fmt / lint /
test / coverage / audit / typecheck). This matrix is the one the GREEN and FINAL
gates run — it is NOT hardcoded in the gate scripts. The rules that governed
planning bind execution.

## Planning → execution handoff gate (OPEN-3: supervisor self-check)

Before the FIRST execution dispatch, run BOTH self-checks yourself:

```
gate-tooling                                  # backends installed? (auto-installs)
gate-stage2-complete docs/agents/sprintN      # every story fully planned + contained?
```

`gate-tooling` blocks (exit 2) unless `md-db` AND `ctx-symbols` are installed — unlike
the per-step gates, execution will NOT start with grep-only fallback. It first waits for
/ runs the one-time build itself; if it still blocks, the human needs a Rust toolchain
(or `SKIP_HOOKS=1` to knowingly accept weakened gates). It also runs as a SubagentStart
hook on every execution role.

Also make sure `docs/agents/defaults.md` exists — if not, run the init flow first (see
"Project setup comes first").

`gate-stage2-complete` blocks unless **every** story in `stories.md` has a
`sN-NN-<slug>/` dir with `tasks.md` + `validate.md` + `plan.md`, no `TBW` remains, the
sprint is **self-contained** (no reference to a later sprint's stories, no work deferred
into one), and md-db validates the tree. Partial Stage-2 is forbidden — all-or-nothing per sprint.
Do not dispatch until both exit 0. (The PostToolUse `gate-validate-artifact`
hook validates each artifact as you write it, regardless.)

================================================================================
# PART B — EXECUTION (autonomous, supervisor present, human absent)

Walk the waves in `sprintN/plan.md` top to bottom. Sibling stories in a wave run
in parallel; wave K starts only after waves 1..K-1 are merged green. One
sub-agent = one task. Every dispatch uses `isolation: "worktree"` — the harness's
built-in worktree isolation creates a `git worktree` per dispatch. If the harness cannot
create a worktree (e.g. an uncommitted or non-git tree), FIX the prerequisite (init +
initial commit) — do NOT fall back to the shared tree. A manual `git worktree add` per
task (reused across the chain, removed on merge/abandon) is a sanctioned equivalent, and
for a non-git VCS the bundled `bin/worktree-create`/`-remove` scripts can be wired into
your user `settings.json`. Either way `assert_worktree_isolation` enforces a real linked
worktree.

## The data plane (on-disk layout — the glue)

```
docs/agents/
  memory.md                                      (you + human, at each retrospective)
  defaults.md                                    (agentic-init) confirmed limits, models, git settings
  NEXT.md                                        (stats sprint-close) the post-/clear handoff
  sprintN/stats.md                               (stats sprint-close) the sprint's numbers
<project>/.agentic/                              run data, fixed layout (bin/_paths.sh), git-ignored:
  transcripts/ budget/ ledger/ logs/ state/
  sprintN/
    stories.md plan.md intake.md standards.md    (you / planning activities)
    execution.log                                (you, via bin/log-execution)
    sN-NN-<slug>/
      tasks.md validate.md plan.md               (planner)
      plan-ready.md                              (you; ticked ONLY on GREEN pass)
      init.md      APPEND-ONLY inbound comms — one block per dispatch (you append)
      output.md    APPEND-ONLY outbound comms — one block per attempt (the agent appends)

  # init.md/output.md are the STORY's comms channel — story-bound, NOT per-attempt dirs.
  # Every task's RED→SCAFFOLD→GREEN(+retries) and structural-review append blocks to the
  # same pair. Each block is headed `## <task> · attempt N · <role> · <ISO8601>`; the file
  # opens with one `--- type: init|output · story: SN-NN ---` frontmatter. Read top-down =
  # the full negotiation history. This is how agents communicate across the chain.

per worktree (transient, git-ignored, removed on stop):
  .agentic/task.env        the per-task contract you write at dispatch (TASK_ID,
                           ATTEMPT, AGENT_ROLE, SCOPE_GLOBS, SCAFFOLD_SYMBOLS, BASE_REF,
                           STORY_DIR, BUDGET_*) — the gates and the time-box hook read
                           this. (Store paths are fixed — never put paths for logs or
                           transcripts in here.)
  .agentic/budget-exceeded marker the time-box hook writes at a HARD limit
                           STORY_DIR is the ABSOLUTE path to sN-NN-<slug>/ (the comms dir).
  .agentic/scaffold-symbols  scaffolder-written production-symbol list (scaffold gate)
  .transcripts/            READ-ONLY task transcript staged in for the worker
```

### Writer rules (who writes what)

- `init.md` (story-bound, **append-only**) — **you** APPEND one block per dispatch:
  `## <task> · attempt N · <role> · <ts>`, then `### Mandate / ### Scope (May / May Not)
  / ### Inputs / ### Acceptance / ### Budget` (the resolved `BUDGET_*` numbers), plus a
  `### Memory` block (the `memory.md` entries
  tagged for this role or `all`, top ~7) and — on a re-spawn — a `### Feedback` block
  derived from the prior `output.md`. It POINTS at `plan-ready.md`; never copies the
  spec. NEVER rewrite an earlier block. The file opens once with `--- type: init ---`.
  At dispatch you also write the worktree's `.agentic/task.env` (with `STORY_DIR` =
  absolute path to this story dir) and `bin/transcripts stage-in` stages `.transcripts/`.
- `output.md` (story-bound, **append-only**) — the **agent** APPENDS one block per
  attempt: `## <task> · attempt N · <role> · <ts>`, `status:`, then `### Summary`, a
  `### Result` table (Check/Status/Detail), optional `### Findings`/`### Scaffold`, and
  `### Next`. A fresh BLOCK per attempt appended to the one file — never a rewrite of an
  earlier block. **Enforced:** every worker gate runs `validate_comms`, which BLOCKS
  unless the latest `output.md` block is present, from the dispatched role, and
  well-formed. This is the inter-agent channel, not an optional artifact.
- `plan-ready.md` — **you** write it once per story after RED is verified; tick a
  box `[ ]→[x]` ONLY when that task's GREEN gate passes. A re-spawn (on fail)
  always precedes ticking, so there is no partial-tick race.
- `execution.log` — **you** append one line per transition via
  `bin/log-execution`. Format enforced by `bin/gate-ledger-format`:
  `<ISO8601> wave-K red|green|scaffold|review|gate SN-NN start|complete …`

### Per-task retry budget (corrections §12 + OPEN-4/6)

The budget is **per task**: it is the count of that task's `output.md` blocks for the
current role (the `attempt N` counter in the block header), and it **resets per task**.
Default **MAX = 3 attempts** before you stop the inner loop and apply escalation (below).
A long run of healthy waves can never trip "retries exhausted" because there is no
cross-wave accumulation. (This is the GATE-failure retry. A BUDGET overrun is never
retried — see "Budget overrun" below.)

### Per-attempt time box (tokens + wall clock)

Every `red-worker` / `scaffolder` / `green-worker` attempt runs under two budgets, each
with a soft and a hard limit. Defaults are deliberately tight — **40k / 60k tokens,
10 / 15 min** — and the project's confirmed values live in `docs/agents/defaults.md`; a single task
may carry a planner-authored `budget:` override line in tasks.md. Tokens = the worker's
current context + all its output tokens; time = wall clock since its first tool call.

The hooks enforce it — you don't: `budget hook` (PreToolUse/PostToolUse on every tool
call, SubagentStop) measures the worker from its own transcript and
- at the **soft** limit tells the worker, inside its tool result, what is left and to
  finish or end gracefully (and once more at 90% of hard);
- at the **hard** limit gives the worker one chance to append its output.md report
  (`status: re-plan`), denies every other tool call (3 refusals), then **stops the worker
  itself** — PostToolUse `continue: false`. No model decides the kill. It also writes
  `.agentic/budget-exceeded`, so the worker's SubagentStop gate releases it *unverified*.

## The feedback loop (exactly)

For each task attempt:

1. You APPEND a dispatch block to the story's `init.md` and dispatch the matching
   `subagent_type` for that `task_id` (worktree), with `STORY_DIR` set in `task.env`.
2. The agent reads its block in `init.md` (+ the chain so far in `output.md`), does the
   work, and APPENDS its report block to the story's `output.md`.
3. On SubagentStop the platform runs the matching gate (`hooks.json`). **exit 0**
   → continue. **exit 2** → the stop is blocked and stderr is handed to you.
4. You read the structured reason + the latest `output.md` block. If within budget,
   APPEND an `attempt N+1` block to `init.md` with a `### Feedback` section and
   re-dispatch the SAME role for the SAME task. Else escalate.

The hook guarantees "you cannot pass a failed gate." You own the
retry-vs-escalate decision.

## The orchestrator loop — dispatch, sleep, sweep

Your job during execution is small, and that is on purpose (it keeps your context short):

1. **Dispatch** every task that can run now (the wave's RED, or GREEN, …) as
   background agents — `run_in_background: true`, `isolation: "worktree"`, `model` from
   defaults.md — after writing each `init.md` block + `task.env` (with
   `BUDGET_*`). Log `start` lines.
2. **Sleep.** Start `budget watch --interval 20 --grace 60` with `run_in_background:
   true` and end your turn. Do nothing else: no polling, no reading worker output early.
   You wake when a worker finishes (task notification) or when `budget watch` exits.
3. **Sweep** on each wake:
   - finished workers → read the gate verdict + latest `output.md` block, and proceed as
     in the feedback loop (tick/merge on pass, retry within the gate-retry budget);
   - `budget watch` printed `STOPPED …` lines (the hook already ended those workers) or
     `KILL …` lines (backstop: the hook could not — `TaskStop` each, then `budget
     mark-killed <agent_id>`) → log `log-execution wave-K budget SN-NN kill Tn
     <tokens/elapsed>` for each, discard its worktree (never merge an overrun attempt).
     Then take the **Budget overrun** route below — do not re-dispatch the task;
   - still-running workers and no kill → start `budget watch` again and sleep.
4. When nothing is running and nothing can be dispatched, the wave is done.

`budget status` prints every tracked attempt's tokens/minutes vs its limits.

## Budget overrun → mid-sprint re-plan (the re-plan route)

A task killed at its hard limit is too big — retrying it would burn the same budget
again. Instead:

1. **Pause the sprint.** Let already-running workers finish (sleep/sweep as usual) but
   dispatch nothing new.
2. **Check the cap:** `budget replans SN-NN-Tn`. At the cap (`AGENTIC_MAX_REPLANS`,
   default 2 splits per task lineage) → escalate as budget/no-progress (hard stop).
3. **Dispatch the planner in re-plan mode** — append an init block from
   `pipeline/planning/02-planner/replan.template.md` (`mode: replan`) listing: DONE tasks
   (merged/ticked — must not be touched), KILLED tasks (with their tokens/minutes, last
   output.md block, transcript path), NOT-STARTED tasks, and the budget in force. Log
   `log-execution wave-K replan SN-NN start Tn`. The planner splits each killed task into
   smaller ones (`split_from: Tn`), removes the original, and updates the waves.
   (Autonomous: this re-plan does NOT wait for the human — splitting a task inside the
   approved sprint scope is not a scope change. Scope changes still escalate.)
4. **Re-validate:** `gate-stage2-complete docs/agents/sprintN` must pass again. Log
   `replan SN-NN complete Tn`.
5. **Resume** the sprint: dispatch the new tasks (from RED) and continue the loop.

## Wave loop — step by step (the run trace)

For wave K, for each task `T<k>`:

**RED** — dispatch `red-worker`.
- The worker writes every test bullet in the task's `plan.md` section at the exact
  `path::fn`, against **minimal `mod common` shims** (each shim carries the marker
  `// agentic:shim`) so each test **FAILS BY ASSERTION** — not by a missing symbol or
  compile error. RED is not vacuous.
- No production code beyond the shims.
- SubagentStop → `gate-red-verify`. It asserts: every new test is FAIL (a new test
  that PASSES exercises nothing → reject), `regressed=0`, and `git diff --stat`
  touches only test files + `tests/common/**`; it validates `output.md` via
  `agent-io.kdl`.
- When all wave-K tasks have clean RED, write each story's `plan-ready.md`
  (same shape as `plan.md`, each box recording actual file/fn + current FAIL
  message).

**SCAFFOLD** — dispatch `scaffolder` (once per story/wave, after RED verified,
before GREEN).
- Reads the verified RED tests + `plan-ready.md`. For every production symbol the
  tests reference, create the canonical stub **once** (signature inferred from the
  test call; body = `panic("SUB-AGENT-TODO: <recipe>")`). Delete the marked shim
  files (`// agentic:shim`) and write the stubbed production symbols, one per line, to
  `.agentic/scaffold-symbols`. Append each create/update/delete to its `output.md` block
  (under `### Scaffold`) and to `execution.log`.
- **Idempotent**: stub only symbols that do not yet exist; NEVER clobber a symbol
  that already has a real (non-panic) body from an earlier wave's GREEN.
- SubagentStop → `gate-scaffold-verify`: each referenced symbol defined **exactly
  once** (`ctx-symbols count == 1` over `.agentic/scaffold-symbols`), every new body
  is `panic+TODO` (a real body where a stub belongs → reject), no marked shim
  (`// agentic:shim`) remains, no clobber.

**GREEN** — dispatch `green-worker` per task.
- Fills the `SUB-AGENT-TODO` bodies with the **bare minimum** to pass exactly this
  task's tests. No new tests, no unforced refactor. Touches only files named in
  `tasks.md` (+ the RED test file, to drop obsolete shims).
- SubagentStop → `gate-green-verify`: this task's tests pass, `regressed=0`, diff
  in `tasks.md` scope, the **standards.md matrix** is green, zero suppressions,
  `output.md` validates.
- On pass: tick the task's boxes in `plan-ready.md` and **merge its worktree** to
  the sprint integration branch.

**STRUCTURAL-REVIEW** — dispatch `structural-reviewer` (read-only) after the
wave's GREEN merges.
- Detects orphan modules, parallel implementations of one abstraction, and
  duplicate helpers (`ctx-symbols conflicts`, grep fallback). Writes findings to
  `output.md`; fixes nothing.
- SubagentStop → `gate-structural-integrity`. Act on the verdict:
  - clean → continue.
  - **isolated + fixable** → re-spawn the implicated GREEN task with feedback via
    `init.md` (RETRY). Do NOT merely "continue."
  - **foundation-poisoning** (HIGH) → **HALT the dependency chain**, **abandon the
    in-flight worktrees** of that chain (keep already-merged waves), and collect
    the escalation.

**WAVE BOUNDARY — no-progress guard.** Compare the ticked-box count in
`execution.log`. A wave that passed its gates but ticked **zero** new
`plan-ready.md` boxes is a stall (cross-wave livelock) → escalate. Otherwise
start the next wave's RED, or if this was the last wave, FINAL-GATE.

**FINAL-GATE** — dispatch `final-gate` once after the last wave's GREEN.
- Runs the full matrix from `standards.md` / `sprintN/plan.md`, greps for zero
  suppressions, walks every `plan-ready.md` for full `[x]`.
- SubagentStop → `gate-final`. Act on the verdict:
  - pass → merge to main / sprint DONE; close the sprint in `execution.log`.
  - **fixable** (a red test, an unticked box, or a matrix failure that is NOT a
    scope issue) → re-dispatch the failing GREEN task. It is NOT a scope change.
  - **scope/plan defect** → escalate. Budget exhausted → hard stop (ABORT).

## Worktree lifecycle

- Each dispatch runs in its own worktree. RED/scaffold/GREEN for a task share that
  task's worktree chain; nothing touches the integration branch until a gate
  passes.
- **Resource pressure → serialize, don't share.** If disk/memory can't sustain
  parallel worktrees, run them ONE AT A TIME and remove each worktree before creating
  the next (`git worktree remove` after merge/abandon). This bounds footprint to a
  single worktree while preserving isolation. Falling back to the shared/main tree is
  NOT a valid response to resource pressure — the worker gates block it.
- **Merge on pass** (GREEN gate green + boxes ticked).
- **Abandon on HALT** (structural foundation-poisoning): drop the chain's
  in-flight worktrees, keep merged waves. Worktree isolation makes "revert on
  halt" clean — there is nothing to unwind on the integration branch.

## Escalation is cause-specific (corrections §12, supersedes a uniform defer)

- **foundation-poisoning** → HALT the dependency chain now (abandon its
  worktrees), keep merged waves.
- **scope / plan defect** → human decision.
- **time-box overrun** (a worker killed at its hard limit) → mid-sprint re-plan (split
  the task), NOT a retry and NOT a hard stop — see "Budget overrun".
- **gate-retry budget exhausted / no-progress / re-plan cap reached** → hard stop.

All escalations RE-ENTER at the **planner** at the next planning session — NOT a
full re-intake. Context preserved = `execution.log` + the story's `init.md`/`output.md`
comms history. The human amends and re-runs. The inner revision loop and
the outer to-planning escalation are the same mechanism at two scales:
escalation is what happens when revision is exhausted.

## Invocation boundary

- PLANNING is a normal interactive session — the human is in the loop; the
  clarify/conflict/re-plan loops are human-bounded.
- EXECUTION is an autonomous run ("run until the sprint gate is green") and takes
  no mid-run human input by design.
- **ONE sprint per autonomous run.** Execution is scoped to a single sprint — its
  FINAL-GATE is the finish line. When it passes, STOP and report; the human decides
  whether to start the next sprint, which RE-ENTERS interactive planning (dispatch the
  planner for it). Never chain Sprint N → N+1 execution in one sweep, and never cross the
  planning→execution boundary without the human's explicit "go".
- **Clear context at every sprint boundary — the harness drives it.** When FINAL-GATE
  passes, `gate-final` runs `stats sprint-close`, which writes `sprintN/stats.md` (tasks
  planned/completed, attempts, gate blocks, budget stops, re-plans, tokens for the
  sprint/session/project, human messages) and `docs/agents/NEXT.md` (the orchestrator
  handoff: what to do next, where we are, the carry-over). At your next Stop the hook
  shows the human the totals and tells you to stop: report them, and ask the human to
  run `/clear`. After `/clear` the SessionStart hook loads `NEXT.md` into the fresh
  context — the next sprint starts from disk, never from conversation memory, which is
  why each sprint's plan must be self-contained. `stats show` prints the totals any time.

## Anti-patterns (reject the sub-agent's output)

- RED that writes production code beyond compile shims, or a RED test that passes
  on first run.
- A scaffolder that implements a body, defines a symbol twice, or clobbers an
  existing implementation.
- GREEN that writes new tests, refactors unforced code, touches out-of-scope
  files, or reaches green by suppressing/weakening a test.
- Any sub-agent that edits a planning artifact.
- A wave starting RED while its upstream wave is not GREEN-complete.
- A final-gate report with any suppression or any unticked `plan-ready.md` box.
- Merging a budget-killed attempt, retrying a budget-killed task as-is, or raising a
  budget mid-sprint to "let it finish" — overruns go to the planner to be split.
- A sprint plan with a task that spills into (or depends on) a later sprint.

## Known gate limitations (compensate in review)

- **Suppression grep is syntactic.** `assert_no_suppression` catches `#[ignore]`,
  `.skip(`, `xit(`, `#[cfg(not(test))]`. It CANNOT see a test that was weakened by
  deleting/replacing an assertion (e.g. `assert!(true)`). The compensating control
  is the RED invariant: a test that was failing in RED and is unchanged in GREEN
  cannot be silently weakened without the diff-scope check flagging the test-file
  edit. When a GREEN attempt edits its RED test file, scrutinize the diff.
- **Backends optional.** With `md-db` absent, artifact structure is frontmatter-only;
  with `ctx-symbols` absent, duplicate detection is name-only grep. Both WARN. A run
  with WARNs has weaker — not absent — gates; install both for full enforcement.

## Validate before you report (self-check loop)

**INVARIANT — nothing goes past a failing self-check.** Every step (intake, standards,
planner, retrospective, RED, scaffold, GREEN, structural-review, final-gate) runs
`selfcheck` and must see `SELF-CHECK PASS` before it reports done or the supervisor
advances. A failing self-check is never overridden. The SubagentStop hook runs the SAME
gate as a backstop for every dispatched role, so a skipped self-check is still caught.

Determinism is LAYERED. The hooks are the backstop — they fire on SubagentStop and
block (exit 2) no matter what. But don't wait for the hook: every worker, before
writing `status: ok` in `output.md`, runs its OWN gate as a pre-flight check — the
SAME script the hook will run:

    selfcheck                # runs your activity's gate, keyed off AGENT_ROLE in task.env

If it prints `SELF-CHECK FAIL`, read the reason, fix the work, and re-run until it
prints `SELF-CHECK PASS`. A PASS here means the hook will pass too — so you never burn
a re-spawn on something you could have caught yourself. After writing any `.md`
artifact, also run:

    md-db validate <dir> --schema schemas/<agent-io|planning-artifacts|memory>.kdl

and fix any schema error before proceeding. The planner runs `selfcheck planner`
(gate-stage2-complete) + `md-db validate` on the planning artifacts before the Stage-2
handoff. This is the plan-validate-execute loop: the worker validates against the same
source of truth the gate uses, so first-pass blocks become rare.

## Available scripts

All of these are on PATH — call them by bare name.

- `selfcheck [role]` — run your activity's gate as a self-check before reporting
  (`selfcheck tooling` runs the execution preflight).
- `gate-tooling` — execution preflight; BLOCKS the first dispatch unless md-db +
  ctx-symbols are installed (auto-installs first; SubagentStart hook + manual check).
- `ensure-tools` — SessionStart installer (`--sync` build now, `--wait`, `--resolve T`).
- `budget` — the time box: `resolve` (BUDGET_* for task.env), `watch` (your sleep),
  `status`, `mark-killed`, `replans` (split-cap check); `hook` is the hook entrypoint.
- `stats show` — token totals (this session, per sprint, whole project); `stats
  sprint-close` is run by gate-final, not by you.
- `agentic-init` — project setup (`--show` / `--apply`), used by the init skill.
- `gate-supervisor-scope` — PreToolUse guard; blocks the supervisor from writing
  production source while a sprint is live this session (code goes through workers).
- `transcripts …` — full interaction capture (managed by hooks; `transcripts --help`).
- `bin/<gate>` — the individual gates (hook-invoked; see `bin/README.md` for each
  gate, its event/matcher, and exit codes).
- `md-db validate … --schema schemas/*.kdl` — validate any `.md` artifact you write.

================================================================================
# PART C — MEMORY & TRANSCRIPTS (the learning + audit loop)

## memory.md (cross-sprint learning)
- Lives at `docs/agents/memory.md` (schema: `schemas/memory.kdl`), curated at every
  retrospective (Step 0). Entries are terse, role-tagged, recurrence-gated.
- On each dispatch inject the entries tagged for that role (or `all`) into the worker's
  `init.md` `# Memory` section, capped ~7 by recurrence/recency.
- Memories are advisory; they never override the playbook or relax a gate. Discard any
  candidate that would (e.g. "skip the flaky test" → instead "fix the flakiness").

## Transcripts (full capture, file-based — bin/transcripts)
- Store at `.agentic/transcripts/` in the main tree (fixed path, git-ignored, never merged):
  - `global.jsonl` — thin cross-task causal stream (tool/file/prompt/stop markers) the
    retrospective scans without reading every payload.
  - `<task>/events.jsonl` — the FULL hook payload per tool call (tool_input +
    tool_response) + every user prompt. Nothing is dropped.
  - `<task>/transcript.jsonl` — the complete session snapshot (every user/assistant
    message + thinking + tool result), copied from the session's `transcript_path` on
    each stop. The main (supervisor) session lands under `<task>=session`.
  You read the GLOBAL stream + any task's full record; a sub-agent only ever sees its
  own task slice.
- Lifecycle (wired in hooks.json, all non-blocking — exit 0):
    UserPromptSubmit → `transcripts prompt`   capture each human message.
    SubagentStart    → `transcripts stage-in` copy this task's slice into the worktree
        as READ-ONLY `.transcripts/` (a frozen pre-run snapshot).
    PostToolUse *    → `transcripts record`   append the full tool payload to the store.
    Stop             → `transcripts snapshot`  snapshot the full session transcript.
    SubagentStop *   → `transcripts stop`      snapshot + remove `.transcripts/` + marker.
- Real isolation = the global store is never staged into the worktree. The read-only
  chmod is the softer "not yours to write" signal (defeatable, but it errors loudly).
- Retention: everything is kept (no auto-compaction). `transcripts prune` is a manual,
  opt-in cap (`AGENTIC_TRANSCRIPTS_KEEP=<n>`) if disk gets tight.

## Worktree hygiene (bin/worktree-hygiene)
- SubagentStart (exec roles) sparse-checkout-excludes `docs/agents/` from the new
  worktree — a worker reaches its story's docs at the absolute `STORY_DIR` path back
  into the main tree, never a copy inside its own worktree, so the checked-out copy is
  pure redundant, would-go-stale weight. Per-worktree config; the main tree and
  sibling worktrees are untouched.
- Same hook bootstraps the main tree's `.gitignore` with `.agentic/`/`.transcripts/`
  the first time a worker runs against it (idempotent — a no-op check after that).
  Fires regardless of whether the harness's built-in `isolation: "worktree"` or the
  optional `bin/worktree-create` made the worktree, since the built-in path never
  calls `worktree-create` at all.
- The retrospective reads this to distill memory. Gate verdicts, supervisor decisions,
  and worktree create/merge/abandon are all captured here.

## The per-worktree contract (.agentic/task.env)
At dispatch, write `.agentic/task.env` into the worktree with `TASK_ID`, `ATTEMPT`,
`AGENT_ROLE`, `STORY_DIR` (absolute path to the story dir — where `validate_comms` reads
init.md/output.md), `SCOPE_GLOBS` (GREEN diff-scope), `SCAFFOLD_SYMBOLS` (or write
`.agentic/scaffold-symbols`), `BASE_REF` (diff base), and the
four `BUDGET_*` lines printed by `budget resolve --tasks <STORY_DIR>/tasks.md --task Tn`. The gate
library sources it, so the gates check the RIGHT task's scope/symbols/comms — not
auto-discovered guesses.

## Reference

- `pipeline/` — the design source of truth (persona / init.template / artifacts /
  gate per activity).
- `schemas/` — md-db KDL schemas (`agent-io`, `planning-artifacts`, `ledger`).
- `bin/` — the gate bodies + `log-execution`.
- `tools/ctx-symbols/` — the symbol backend (build + install per its README).
- `bin/_paths.sh` / `bin/_paths.py` — the one definition of the file layout.
- Backends: `md-db` (artifact validation) and `ctx-symbols` (code-structure checks),
  auto-installed by `ensure-tools`. Planning gates degrade to grep with a WARN if they
  are missing; execution does not start without them.
